    "## EXAMPLE: Probability of disease given symptoms\n",
    "Let's assume we want to calculate the probability of having COVID-19 based on three possible symptoms: high fever, continuos cough, loss of taste/smell.\n",
    "We know there are 1% chances of being infected, and in such case the probabilities of developing the symptoms are as follows:\n",
    "- high fever: 10% with COVID, only 2% without\n",
    "- continuos cough: 20% with COVID, only 5% without\n",
    "- loss of taste/smell: 15% with COVID, only 0.1% without\n",
    "\n",
    "> __QUESTION:__ What is the probability of having COVID given the presence of all the three symptoms?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four random variables, which can be either *true* or *false*:\n",
    "- COVID disease $D$\n",
    "- fever $F$\n",
    "- cough $C$\n",
    "- loss of taste/smell $L$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simpliciy, we will use lower-case letters to indicate single events (e.g. $d$ means $D = true$ and $¬d$ means $D = false$).\n",
    "The task then consists in computing the probability $P(d | f, c, l)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the following probability distributions, given by the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(d) = 0.01 \\\\\n",
    "P(¬d) = 0.99\n",
    "$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "{\\bf P}(D) = \\langle 0.01, 0.99 \\rangle\n",

    "A little more complicated is to extract a conditional probablity. For example, what about $P(G_3 = A | G_2 = C)$?\n",
    "- there are four cases in which $G_2 = C$ (Sarah, Paul, Jack, and Tom)\n",

    "Let's see if this could also be calculated differently:\n",
    "- there is only one case (Paul) in which $G_2 = C$ and $G_3 = A$, therefore $P(G_2 = C, G_3 = A) = 1/10$\n",

In general this is not true though, since even a small change in our data could cause significant changes in the probabilities (try to recompute the above in case Jack had a B in Year 2: what do you get?).
